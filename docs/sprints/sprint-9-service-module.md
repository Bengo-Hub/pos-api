# Sprint 9: Service Business Module — pos-api

**Status:** ✅ Core Delivered — appointments (full CRUD + all status actions), staff schedules, commissions, walk-in queue, and resource management shipped; packages, client records CRUD, and commission rules/payout pending  
**Period:** September–October 2026  
**Last updated:** 2026-05-25  
**Goal:** Appointments, staff commissions, service queues, and packages for barbershop/salon, clinic, car wash, and service-based businesses

## Context

Service businesses differ from retail and hospitality:
- Revenue is time-based, not product-based — a service occupies a staff member and/or a resource (chair, bay, room) for a defined duration
- Appointments are the primary scheduling unit; walk-ins join a service queue
- Staff earn commissions on services they perform — commission structures vary (flat, percentage, tiered)
- Packages and bundles allow pre-purchase of multiple sessions at a discount
- A "sale" may span multiple visits (e.g., a course of treatments)
- Clinics require patient records and visit notes; salons require client preference cards

The `Appointment`, `StaffMember`, and `CommissionRecord` schemas already exist in the codebase. This sprint completes the HTTP layer and adds package/bundle and service queue management.

## Completion Notes (2026-05-25)

Full appointment CRUD and all status action endpoints are shipped. Walk-in queue (list/create/patch status) is implemented under `RequireUseCase("services")`. Resource management (list/create/patch status) is implemented with `Resource` ent schema and Atlas migration. Commission records (list/get) are shipped. Service packages, client records CRUD, commission rules/payout, and appointment-to-resource conflict detection remain unimplemented.

Implemented route coverage:
- `GET /appointments`, `POST /appointments`, `GET /appointments/availability`, `GET /appointments/{id}`, `PUT /appointments/{id}` — all under `RequireUseCase("services")`
- `POST /appointments/{id}/check-in`, `POST /appointments/{id}/start`, `POST /appointments/{id}/complete`, `POST /appointments/{id}/cancel`, `POST /appointments/{id}/no-show`
- `GET /queue`, `POST /queue/entries`, `PATCH /queue/entries/{entryID}/status` — under `RequireUseCase("services")`
- `GET /resources`, `POST /resources`, `PATCH /resources/{resourceID}` — under `RequireUseCase("services")`
- `GET /staff/{staffID}/schedule`, `PUT /staff/{staffID}/schedule`
- `GET /commissions`, `GET /commissions/{id}`
